General HydroBOT components,Type,General component definitions,Specific components used in our example,Details of Specific components
Input data,Not part of HydroBOT,"Hydrologic data (timeseries). Typically representing multiple scenarios, e.g. climate and climate adaptations. May include other inputs as needed by response models. ","Modified historical hydrographs to represent hypothetical climate change and adaptations (45 gauges, 15 scenarios)",Daily flow rates for 45 for 36 scenarios
Controller,Workflow,"Interface between input data, response model, and other toolkit components. Sets up run(s).",Sets up links to data and parameters for EWR tool and aggregations.,
Response models,"External, integrated","A model of the response of values, e.g.  social, cultural, environmental, or economic values in response to hydrologic drivers. ",EWR tool,"The EWR tool holds databases of the EWRs required to meet the environmental objectives of the basin, which protect or enhance environmental assets that are valued based on ecological significance. "
Aggregator,Workflow,"Aggregates response model results to scales across the dimensions of time, space, and theme. ",Response model sets the base scale for aggregation. EWR tool assesses hydrologic indicators (value) at gauges (space) and year (time).,"The spatial dimension consists of gauges nested within planning units within the basin. The time dimension assessess EWR performance averaged over the yearly data returned by the EWR tool. The value dimension consists of multiple EWRs (hydrologic indicators) that apply to environmental values (many-to-many), at multiple levels in the causal network (e.g. life-cycle components, species, groups of species, or long-term planning targets)."
Comparer,Workflow,"Compares scenarios (typically) or other groupings. Provides standard outputs including comparison methods, plots, and tables.",Comparison of environmental values at various theme scales for the example climate and adaptation scenarios,Explored in detail in figures and tables
Causal networks,"External, integrated",Describe causal relationships between values.,Long Term Water Plan (LTWP) ,Provided by HydroBOT. LTWP required of Basin States by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and give effect to the Basin-wide Environmental Watering Strategy. 
Spatial data,"External, integrated",Describe spatial relationships,"Gauge locations, Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDL) units, Murray-Darling Basin","Sourced from MDBA, representing the gauges at which EWRs are assessed and the spatial units for many management needs, provided by HydroBOT as sf objects."
