	abstract = {Using ecological-response models to understand and improve management of aquatic ecosystems is increasingly common. However, there are many questions about reliability and utility that can make the use of ecological modelling fraught. One critical question is how ecological-response models translate to what happens in practice. Many models purport to improve management by simulating ecological response to changing conditions. This suggests that tangible benefits (e.g. increased biodiversity) should flow when recommendations for action are implemented. But testing these links is rare and there are implications if those links are tenuous. One problem leading to a lack of congruence between models and reality can be a lack of ecological data for the system being modelled. Incomplete understanding, erroneous assumptions about drivers or degree of variability, and uncritical use of expert opinion can all result in models that may be more likely to mislead than inform. Explicit validation of models, sensitivity testing and ongoing development of novel solutions to deal with incomplete data can all assist. So, wise and critical use of ecological models provides one mechanism to increase our ability to quantify adverse effects on, and project future trajectories of, aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Murray–Darling Basin (MDB) is home to two million people and accounts for about 60\% of the water use in Australia. The MDB river system is a highly complex and mostly regulated system covering four states (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia) and one territory. Different jurisdictions used different models for water resources and planning. A number of difficulties were faced in combining those models (of different characteristics and spatio-temporal resolutions) for basin-wide water resources planning. In order to overcome those difficulties and enhance the consistency and transparency in modelling outcomes across multiple jurisdictions, this paper proposes a homogeneous agent-based integrated modelling framework. Each agent is used to represent a region in the MDB. Its behaviour is modelled by a newly built Source river model. The interactions between agents are modelled based on the hydrological connectivity in the real-world river systems. A three-level parallel computing mechanism is developed to significantly increase its efficiency and reduce computational time. Due to its homogeneousness, it largely reduces the system complexity and makes modelling results consistent, explainable and comparable. By nature, the agent-based system is flexible and portable. All these unique features of the platform suit the modelling needs of various states to federal government water resource management agencies.},

	abstract = {Greater scientific knowledge, changing societal values, and legislative mandates have emphasized the importance of implementing large-scale flow experiments (FEs) downstream of dams. We provide the first global assessment of FEs to evaluate their success in advancing science and informing management decisions. Systematic review of 113 FEs across 20 countries revealed that clear articulation of experimental objectives, while not universally practiced, was crucial for achieving management outcomes and changing dam-operating policies. Furthermore, changes to dam operations were three times less likely when FEs were conducted primarily for scientific purposes. Despite the recognized importance of riverine flow regimes, four-fifths of FEs involved only discrete flow events. Over three-quarters of FEs documented both abiotic and biotic outcomes, but only one-third examined multiple taxonomic responses, thus limiting how FE results can inform holistic dam management. Future FEs will present new opportunities to ...},

Ecosystem types within the Basin are diverse, ranging from small upland streams to the coastal estuary at the river mouth. The vast floodplains and associated rivers and wetlands are the most iconic habitats of the MDB, together with rich communities of plants, birds, fish, and other organisms. The diversity of ecosystem types are summarised, as are each of the major biotic groups making up the Basins’ flora and fauna. The links to hydrology, and, in particular, the role of floods and droughts in the life cycle of these various organisms. Land clearing and flow alteration associated with agriculture and water resource development have had a significant impact on the condition of aquatic ecosystems in the MDB, and climate change is now also emerging as a major threat. These impacts are discussed, together with a brief overview of current efforts to mitigate them and to restore the health of aquatic ecosystems, particularly the more heavily impacted lowland areas and the coastal estuary.},
