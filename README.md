# toolkit-demo-paper

This builds the demo paper. I've moved it here so we can edit without being public, though that means we need to copy-paste over the `_images` and `more_scenarios` folders for the code to run. The things in those folders are based on the current version of the toolkit run in the `feat_galen` branch.

Both the demo and this need to be run from the current version of the toolkit (contains plot tweaks that aren't ready for main) from 

`devtools::install_git("git@github.com:MDBAuth/WERP_toolkit.git", ref = 'galen_working', force = TRUE, upgrade = 'ask', git = 'external')`

The rendered website, along with links to a word doc and pdf are at [https://animated-doodle-4g9vwqm.pages.github.io/presentation_paper/demo_paper.html](https://animated-doodle-4g9vwqm.pages.github.io/presentation_paper/demo_paper.html).

In-html highlighting is available- select some text, click the Annotate button, and it'll prompt you to create a [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) account. Comments are public by default, but let me know once you have an account and I'll create a private group.
