General Toolkit components,General component definitions,Specific components used in our example,Details of Specific components
Input data,"Hydrologic data (timeseries). Typically representing multiple scenarios, e.g. climate and climate adaptations. May include other inputs as needed by response models. ",Modified historical hydrographs to represent hypothetical climate change and adaptations,Daily flow rates for NUMBER GAUGES for 15 scenarios
Controller,"Interface between input data, response model, and other toolkit components. Sets up run(s).",Sets up links to data and parameters for EWR tool,
Response models,"A model that contains are set of causal relationships between a driver and responses, e.g.  social, cultural, environmental, or economic values. ",Specific response model = EWR tool,"The EWR tool holds databases of the EWRs required to meet the environmental objectives of the basin, which protect or enhance environmental assets that are valued based on ecological significance. "
,,Specific response  = EWR (environmental water requirement),"EWRs describe the volume, frequency, timing and duration of flows or inundation required to support the completion of all components of a lifecycle of an organism or group of organisms (taxonomic or spatial), consistent with the objective/target, measured at the most appropriate gauge [LTWP]. "
Aggregator,"Aggregates response model results to scales across the dimensions of time, space, and theme. ",Response model sets the base scale for aggregation. EWR tool assesses hydrologic indicators (theme) at gauges (space) and internally aggregates over time.,The spatial dimension consists of gauges nested within planning units within the basin.
,,,"The theme dimension consists of multiple EWRs (hydrologic indicators) that apply to environmental objectives (many-to-one), which apply to other levels in the causal network (e.g. Objectives, Targets, and Long-term targets)."
Comparer,"Compares scenarios (typically) or other groupings. Provides standard outputs including comparison methods, plots, and tables.",Comparison of environmental values at various theme scales for the example climate and adaptation scenarios,-
Causal networks,Describe causal relationships between values.,Long Term Water Plan (LTWP) ,"Plans required of Basin States by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Long term water plans give effect to the Basin-wide Environmental Watering Strategy relevant for each river system and will guide the management of water over the longer term. These plans will identify the environmental assets that are dependent on water for their persistence, and match that need to the water available to be managed for or delivered to them. The plan will set objectives, targets and watering requirements for key plants, waterbirds, fish and ecosystem functions. DPIE is responsible for the development of nine plans for river catchments across NSW, with objectives for five, 10 and 20-year timeframes.  "
